## Project Overview
The goal is to detect phishing emails in imbalanced datasets using:
1. SMOTE for basic oversampling
2. image-SMOTified-GAN for improved synthetic sample generation
3. MCMC-GAN for diverse sample generation
4. Other GAN variations (DCGAN, WGAN, etc.)
5. Classifiers (Random Forest, BERT) for evaluation

## Setup
